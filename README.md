QuickSlot — Hiring Hackathon Problem Statement
Role: Flutter Mobile Developer (with backend skills) · Format: Live, individual · Build time: 6
hours, then demo + defense round

Before the event (mandatory — do this at home)
Come with a fully working setup. No setup time will be given on the day:
• Flutter SDK installed, flutter doctor clean, Android emulator or a physical device
working
• Runtime installed for your backend language of choice (Node / Python / Go / Java / Dart —
anything)
• Git, your IDE, and any AI tools you plan to use — installed and logged in
The problem
Build QuickSlot — a mini app for booking sports slots (badminton courts / turf grounds). Users
browse venues, view time slots for a date, and book one.
The one hard rule: a slot can never be double-booked. If two users tap "Book" on the same slot
at the same instant, exactly one succeeds and the other gets a clear in-app message. We will test
this live from two devices.
Part A — Backend (any language, any database)
A REST API with real persistence (SQLite / Postgres / MySQL / Mongo — your choice). Seed 3–5
venues, each with hourly slots from 6 AM to 10 PM.
Endpoint What it does
GET /venues List venues
GET /venues/{id}/slots?
date=YYYY-MM-DD

Slots for a date, with status

POST /bookings Book a slot for a user — must be concurrency-
safe; return correct status codes for success / slot

already taken / invalid input
GET /users/{id}/bookings A user's bookings
DELETE /bookings/{id} Cancel a booking

Keep auth light: hardcoded users plus an X-User-Id header is acceptable. Do not burn time
building full auth.

Part B — Flutter app
1. User select / login — keep it simple
2. Venue list → venue detail — date picker + slot grid, available vs booked clearly visible
3. Booking flow — confirm → success; if the slot was just taken by someone else, show a
graceful message and refresh the grid
4. My Bookings — list with cancel
Required everywhere: loading, error, and empty states. Any state management (Provider /
Riverpod / Bloc / GetX) — you will be asked to justify your choice.
Rules
1. AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot...) are allowed and expected — same as
the real job. But you must understand every line. The defense round includes explaining
randomly chosen parts of your code and making a small live change to it.
2. Commit to git at least every 45 minutes with meaningful messages. One giant final commit
= penalty.
3. Official framework starters are fine; personal pre-built boilerplates are not.
4. Everything must run locally on your laptop for the demo (backend + app together).

Bonus (attempt max 2, only after the core works end-to-end)
• Slot status updates via polling or websocket (a slot flips to "booked" on another phone
without restarting)
• Offline read cache for My Bookings
• Unit tests for booking logic, or one widget test
• Dockerized backend
• Filter slots by time of day
Deliverables
1. Git repo (monorepo is fine: /app, /server)
2. README containing: setup steps, a short architecture note (a paragraph + a photo of a
whiteboard sketch is fine), what you cut and why, what you'd do with one more day, and an
AI usage note — what you used AI for and one thing it got wrong that you caught and fixed
3. 10-min demo + ~15-min defense
How you'll be evaluated
• Working core booking flow, demoed on a device

• The live double-booking test (two judges, two phones, same slot)
• Backend & API quality: schema, validation, status codes, your concurrency approach
• Flutter code quality: structure, state management, no business logic inside widgets,
error/empty/loading states handled
• Defense round: explain your decisions, walk through code we pick, implement one small
new requirement live
• Judgment: commit history, README honesty, scope decisions
A smaller app that is correct, well-structured, and fully understood beats a feature-stuffed app you
can't explain. Cutting scope deliberately — and saying so in the README — is a positive signal.
Sample day schedule
9:00 kickoff + Q&A · 9:30–15:30 build (hard code freeze) · 15:45 onwards demos + defense in
random order · results the same evening or next day
